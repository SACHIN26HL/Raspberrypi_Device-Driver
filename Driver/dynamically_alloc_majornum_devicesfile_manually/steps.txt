Manually Creating Device File

We can create the device file manually by using mknod.

mknod -m <permissions> <name> <device type> <major> <minor>

<name> – your device file name that should have a full path (/dev/name)

<device type> – Put c or b

c – Character Device

b – Block Device

<major> – major number of your driver

<minor> – minor number of your driver

-m <permissions> – optional argument that sets the permission bits of the new device file to permissions

Example:
sudo mknod -m 666 /dev/etx_device c 246 0

If you don’t want to give permission, You can also use chmod to set the permissions for a device file after creation.
Advantages

    Anyone can create the device file using this method.
